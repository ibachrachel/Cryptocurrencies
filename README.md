# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18 Challenge


## Overview

*Background*

Martha would like our help to pitch an investment for cryptocurrency to her firm, Accountability Accountants. The popularity of BitCoin has made it unaffordable to new investors. Thankfully, there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies that can be great starter investments. Using unsupervised machine learning, Martha would like us to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrenies. Unsupervised machine learning only uses input data, so this is a perfect usage. The result should be the UML learning a pattern within the data and helping Martha to decide which currency to pitch.
