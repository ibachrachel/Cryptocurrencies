# Cryptocurrencies

Module 18 Challenge


## Overview

*Background*

Martha would like our help to pitch an investment for cryptocurrency to her firm, Accountability Accountants. The popularity of BitCoin has made it unaffordable to new investors. Thankfully, there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies that can be great starter investments. Using unsupervised machine learning, Martha would like us to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrenies. Unsupervised machine learning only uses input data, so this is a perfect usage. The result should be the UML learning a pattern within the data and helping Martha to decide which currency to pitch. 


*Purpose*

You and Martha have done your research. You understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. It’s time to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of your most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. She’ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.

-Plotly Express
-scikit-learn

## Analysis

*Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA*

The IsTrading column is dropped, rows that have null values are removed, and the CoinName column is removed. We further prepared the data using the sklearn library to standarize the features. Without this preparation, the next steps would not be possible
